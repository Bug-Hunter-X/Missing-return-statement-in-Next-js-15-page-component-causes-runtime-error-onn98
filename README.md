# Missing Return Statement in Next.js 15 Page Component

This repository demonstrates a common error in Next.js 15 applications where a missing `return` statement in a page component causes a runtime error, particularly noticeable in production mode.

## Bug Description

A Next.js 15 application throws an error in production mode if a page component is missing a `return` statement. This is because the component is expected to return JSX to be rendered.  The error may not always be immediately apparent in development mode.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server. The application should run without error, although a warning might be present in the browser console.
4. Run `npm run build` and `npm run start` to start the production server. This will trigger the runtime error.

## Solution

The solution is to ensure that every page component in your Next.js application has a `return` statement that returns the JSX to be rendered.  If you intend for the component to render nothing, return `null`.

## Additional Notes

This error is likely to cause problems when deploying to production environments. Thorough testing is essential to prevent this issue.  Always ensure that all your page components have a valid `return` statement.
